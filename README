Some long-time REXX programmers switching to Perl find it difficult 
to give up REXX's template-based parsing abilities.  This module is 
my attempt to provide such parsing in Perl.  The documentation assumes 
a familiarity with REXX parse statements.


I tested this module on OS/2, Linux (RedHat 6.1), AIX, and OS/390.  It
should work exactly the same on any platform.

        first template item. 

1.02  Sat Sep 4 1999
      - Fixed incorrect handling of variable pattern in template 
        when variable's value contains regex meta characters. 

1.03  Sat Sep 6 1999
      - Fixed incorrect handling of template when two or more
        patterns are next to each other, or when last template

1.06  Sun Mar 26 2000
      - Internal optimizations for the following type of templates:
        - template is only a single lvalue
        - template is only lvalues and '.' place holders
        - template is only patterns, lvalues, and '.' place holders
      - Removed my email address to avoid spam.  My email address
        will be returned by calling String::RexxParse->email from 
        a perl program that uses String::RexxParse.

        to be parsed is shorter than the pattern calls for.
